X Build process: :: 

X test if the rendering logic works
X test if the fetching logic works

X handle movement: rerendering only

  // dashboard calls cancelAllPending on sithList...
    - sithList invokes on all. How could composition work???
- handle movement: retriggering fetching
  // OPT1: have a mediator in dashboard that listens for a 
  // OPT2: the shift function has side efects, but we can also get it to return a value...keep the logic in there. This is messy though. 
- offbutton logic.
  // High level: 
    -ALL OFF: on match events. 
    -One off on edge events.
    -(Both, if would have been active) --> on ">1 sith loaded.css-slots"
